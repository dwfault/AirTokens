### Link_Platform_\_LNK\_



https://etherscan.io/address/0xe2e6d4be086c6938b53b22144855eef674281639#code



```javascript
contract LinkToken is StandardToken, Ownable {

    string public   name =           "Link Platform";    // Name of the Token
    string public   symbol =         "LNK";              // ERC20 compliant Token code
    uint public     decimals =       18;                 // Token has 18 digit precision
    uint public     totalSupply;    			         // Total supply

    function mint(address _spender, uint _value)
        onlyOwner {

        balances[_spender] += _value;
        totalSupply += _value;
    }
}
```



The LNK token could be arbitary minted by its creator in function mint. The balances[_spender] and ) _value are a defined as uint, so oprator '+' would definitely result in an interger overflow.



Simulated on Remix:

The owner of the contract could mint arbitary amout of  (for example 0x8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Wei) subconcurrency LNK to an arbitary user.

If the owner of the contract mint another 0x8000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 LNK to the user again,  integer overflow happened which make balanceOf this user to be 0.



This is a serious problem for digital assets. Not a good thing for an organization who has a  poor code but fancy website(https://cryptolink.network).
